My Keynote slide deck from React Europe 2015

This is the keynote file for my React Europe slide deck.

I've had a number of people ask how I did my slides. So, here they are. Eat your heart out!

## License

There's currently no license. I'm totally open to licensing this, I just don't know how.

I'd like a license that prevents people from delivering this talk as their own, in part or in whole. Other than that, I don't care a whole lot.

If you know of a license that is flexible on everything but that, open a PR. Until then...
